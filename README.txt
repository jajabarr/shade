You must reach 8 caves to beat the game.

As you play, the shade [S] will collpse upon you,
and the beasts [B] will always be closer.

Don't let either of them touch you.

Wizards [W] hold mighty secrets essential to your survival.

To move:

MOVE UP - w
MOVE DOWN - s
MOVE LEFT - a
MOVE RIGHT - d

Then press enter after each input, i.e. w [enter], a [enter], etc.

Good luck.
